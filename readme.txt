# ✈️ Airline Traffic Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📁 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **real-world airline and city traffic data** using **SQL**.  
The goal is to uncover patterns in:  
- Passenger movement  
- Freight & mail volume  
- Airline performance  
- City connectivity

## 📊 Datasets Used  
| File Name            | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **airline_stats.csv** | Airline-wise performance metrics (passengers, load factor, freight, mail) |
| **city_traffic.csv** | Monthly city-to-city traffic data (passengers, freight, mail) |

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed  

✔️ **Top 5 city pairs by:**  
   - ✈️ Passenger volume  
   - 📦 Freight movement  
   - ✉️ Mail volume  

✔️ **Year-over-Year growth** of passengers  
✔️ **Average load factor** by airline  
✔️ **Top airlines** by passenger traffic  
✔️ **Cities that act only as sources** (never destinations)  
✔️ **Freight vs Mail % contribution** per airline
